# CS340-Final-Project
Final Dashboard for Grazioso Salvare Animal Rescue Filtered Database

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

-I write code with clear structure, separation of concerns, and consistent naming. In Project One, the CRUD module centralized all database operations, making the Project Two dashboard simpler and easier to maintain. This   approach allows changes to the database logic without touching the UI. The same module could be reused in future tools, APIs, or scripts that need reliable database access.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

-I break problems into small, testable parts, starting with requirements and data exploration. For Grazioso Salvare, I mapped each rescue type to MongoDB queries, tested them, then connected them step-by-step to the dashboard components. Compared to earlier assignments, I focused more on schema inspection, error handling, and performance. In the future Iâ€™d add indexing, automation, and schema checks to speed setup and ensure reliability.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

-Computer scientists turn real needs into efficient, reliable systems. For Grazioso Salvare, the dashboard streamlines searching and visualizing dogs that fit rescue criteria, helping staff make faster, better decisions and freeing them to focus on rescue work instead of data wrangling.
